# Stock-Price-Prediction

Stock Analysis, also known as Market Analysis topic, approaches the method that investors or traders use to evaluate the price and investigate a specific trading instrument, investment sector or the entire stock market. No way, it involves the work of studying past and present market data and creating a method to choose the right stocks to trade. Advisors will make buy or sell decisions based on stock information analysis.

# About the data

This project will use Python languague, at the same time, use Backfill methods to clean data. Normalization to scale data. Then use PCA to reduce the data dimensionality and use K-means clustering to analyze.
